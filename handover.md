# Project Handover

## Recent Progress

1. Implemented offline data persistence using IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
2. Updated PersonContext and PersonManager to handle async storage operations
3. Fixed TypeScript errors in PersonManager.test.tsx:
   - Fixed error type handling in mock context
   - Fixed Person2 id type to be specifically 1 | 2
   - Fixed window.location mocking
4. Updated loading state test in PersonManager.test.tsx:
   - Added data-testid to loading spinner
   - Updated test assertions
   - All 11 tests now passing

## Current State

1. Mobile optimization is working with:
   - Touch interactions
   - Responsive layout
   - Mobile-specific components
2. Storage system is now async and supports offline usage
3. Test suite is updated and passing
4. Project board issues have been moved to Done

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing additional offline features:
   - Offline sync queue
   - Conflict resolution
   - Sync status indicators
2. Add error recovery mechanisms for storage operations
3. Add more specific test cases for:
   - Offline behavior
   - Storage edge cases
   - Mobile-specific interactions
4. Update documentation with:
   - Offline capabilities
   - Storage architecture
   - Testing approach

## Known Issues

1. Some TypeScript linter errors in mobile components need attention
2. Need to verify mobile touch interactions across different devices
3. Storage operations could benefit from retry mechanisms
4. Test coverage could be improved for error scenarios

## Questions to Address

1. Should we implement a more robust offline sync system?
2. Do we need additional error recovery mechanisms?
3. Should we add more comprehensive mobile testing?
4. Are there any performance optimizations needed for storage operations?

## Dependencies

- IndexedDB for primary storage
- localStorage for fallback
- Testing library for component tests
- Mobile-specific UI components

## Notes

- All critical functionality is working
- Test suite provides good coverage of core features
- Mobile optimization is largely complete
- Storage system is functional but could be enhanced
